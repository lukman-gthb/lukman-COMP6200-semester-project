# COMP6200 Data Science Portfolio 

### Lukman

This repository is created to fulfill Macquarie University COMP6200 Data Science subject assesment and this repository's purpose is to apply all the tecniques and methodologies that are learned in the class in order to gain deeper understanding. There might be several theoretical and practical errors when applying the techniques and any corrections, sugestions and ideas are welcomed.

All of data in repositories is subset of 2016 Census and is from Australian Bureau of Statistics. The dataset is extracted using Table Builder tool. The data is under creative common license [creative common license](https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/Home/Creative%20Commons%20licensing) and can be used for education purpose.

This project goal is to find the answer to the following question: 
Given data that is not geographical, is it possible to predict whether a location, in this case a suburb is near beach or not?

A lot of things were learned in COMP6200 Data Science class and this repository represent only small portion of techniques and methodologies that were learned.
